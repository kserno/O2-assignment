# O2 Interview Assignment

Hey, so this is my assignment's solution. About the architecture, I went 
with clean architecture + MVVM solution, if everything was as it is supposed to, every feature
would have it's own module (activation, card, scratch) and it's module would have 3 separate submodule (ui/data/domain).
I have created it with the same structure as is it is supposed to be, but I didn't bother to separate it 
into standalone gradle modules as it is a tedious task and it doesn't show my coding expertise, so pardon me for not doing this :)
